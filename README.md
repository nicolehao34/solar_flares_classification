Solar flares classification using SciKitLearn supervised ML algorithms


# SVM_nonlinear_3labels_experiments
Trained SVM model on labeled data. 3 labels were used: no flare, weak flares, and strong flares. Only the no flare class was correctly classified. Therefore we decided to check how many weak flare data points there are.
